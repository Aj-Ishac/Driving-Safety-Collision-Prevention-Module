IoT product built using the Arduino infrastructure to specialize in gathering valuable information to keep you and
your vehicle safe. The device uses strong magnets to attach to any metallic surface at an angle of the userâ€™s choice and uses Ultrasonic
to track distance to objects and other tech for temp and humidity.

Gathered data is relayed to the user through Bluetooth to the Android app to warn and alert the user when objects are detected within range posing a danger.

Product requirements: cost effective, fast feedback run-time, portable, weather-proof. 

The project has been a valuable learning experience in terms of building a product around constraints based on similar products on the
market and safety standards.

Backend: C++ Arduino  
Frontend: MIT App Inventor
