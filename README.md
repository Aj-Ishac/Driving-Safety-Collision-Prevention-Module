IoT product built using the Arduino infrastructure to specialize in gathering valuable information to keep you and
your vehicle safe. The device uses strong magnets to attach to any metallic surface at an angle of the userâ€™s choice and uses Ultrasonic
to track distance to objects and other tech for temp and humidity. 

Gathered data is relayed to the user through Bluetooth to the Android app to warn and alert the user when objects are detected within range posing a danger.

**Backend:**   Arduino C++  
**Frontend:** MIT App Inventor

**Product requirements:**
- Cost Effective
- Response Time
- Portability
- Weather and Splash Resistant
- User Customization  

Requirements and constraints were developed with competitive market products in mind and with respect to automobile equipment safety regulations.
